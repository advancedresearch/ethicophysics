various mathematical properties arising from the exercise of free will by the human animal


Started by Dr. Eric Purdy. Right now, exists primarily in the issue tracker. Ultimately, we would like to be able to run simulations that demonstrate that good things defeat evil things in the sorts of scenarios that arise in modern life, as a sort of dry run for superintelligence when it arrives.

Subprojects:
* The Anti-Psychotic Q-Learner Trick: a method for constraining reinforcement learning agents in their pursuit of goals
* Purdy's Theory of Social Facts: a theoretical framework for analyzing "things that everyone knows"
