# Semiotic Expressions

Some random code I had lying around from 2012, that the state of the art never
exactly, precisely caught up to. I think it does a pretty good job of
explaining more or less why deep learning works, and presumably considering
both at the same time would be fruitful.

Code is a fragment of a larger project that never really went anywhere
huge. Mainly it should be considered documentation of a useful idea rather than
code that one would actually run.
