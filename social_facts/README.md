# Purdy's theory of social facts

Why is it that certain things, mere social conventions, have the force of
physical law in our lives? We cannot drive on the wrong side of the road
without risking death and grave injury, for instance. This theory provides a
fairly natural explanation of such things in terms of things we already believe
to be true.

Code and PDF describing the theory is located in the directory
social_facts. Note that the code is pretty rough and could stand to be cleaned
up, and that, as always, more experiments are needed.
